# 3D Connect 4 - AI for Games
A connect four game with 3 dimensions of play, using AI as an opponent.

## General Notes
Due to time limitations:
- The result of a game (who won, or if there's a draw) are outputted exclusively through the console, along with a record of all previous moves (where X represents the red player and O represents the yellow player),
- And the game must be restarted manually by re-running the exe.

If you fancy a larger window size, uncomment line 33 in Window.h.

## Notes for Grading
The team agreed that both members evenly split the work 50/50.
